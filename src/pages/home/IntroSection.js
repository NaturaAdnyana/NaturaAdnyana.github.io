              Introduce me - "Natura Adnyana" 20yo
            </h3>
            <p>
              So you can call me <i>Natura</i> or <i>Natsura</i> or {"  "}
              <i>Natkun</i> (people calls me like that). It's sounds like
              Japanese name right? Well I'm actually half Japanese/Indonesian,
              live in the beautiful island called Bali. <br />
              I'm a web developer and also a student of the INSTIKI Indonesia
              University. I love technology (literally to broke something) since
              I'm on 13 years old, started from when I trying to disassemble my
              new phone, fixing my cheap electronic gadgets, cracking softwares,
              and now I'm trying to make a website. My goal is to be a Software
              Engineer. It's still a long journey, so let's see what will happen
              to me nextðŸ¦¾.
